# Project 2

### Description:
The purpose of this script is to provide a convenient monitor for one's computer performance, displaying real-time performance metrics of the CPU, GPU, and RAM, all within a single graph for side-by-side observation. It updates every 1 second, displaying up to the past 50 seconds for a more meaningful data collection. The intention of this scripts is that the user can utilize this as a simple, generic monitoring tool that provides just enough information to satisfy the specific needs.


### Installation:
After downloading the files in this folder, run the command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

This will automatically ensure all required modules are installed. After this, run this command for the actual script:

    python.exe project2.py
Afterwards, the script should open a small window, from which it can be positioned into the most favorable spot for one's desired effect.
